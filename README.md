Kickstarting with Excel

Overview of Project 

After the end of Louise's play, her fundraising goal came to an end.  She wanted to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their 
funding goals, so that she can compare her own outcomes vs goals, and outcomes vs launch with other plays' outcomes vs goals as well as outcomes vs launch 

Purpose : 

The purpose of this analysis is to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. This data helped Louise figure out if 
launch month date has any impact on outcomes of campaign, and what would be a good time to launch campaign. Louise also wanted to know if Goals have an impact on outcomes of the 
campaigns or not. 

Analysis

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date : 

![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://github.com/faria-farin/MSUBootcamp_Challenge1/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
 
From the chart we can see that, the most successful campaigns occurs during the start of summer and end of Spring between May -July, 
and failed campaign is not as significantly as high as successful campaigns howvever, during winter or start of fall Nov-Jan, there is a decrease in overall successful campaign.  
The number of canceled campaigns remains almost similar

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals : 

![Outcomes_vs_Goal](https://github.com/faria-farin/MSUBootcamp_Challenge1/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goal.png)
 
Here, there is an interesting thing we see that is there is zero canceled campaigns, particulary in play - subcatergory. The percentage failures is highest with high goal 
amount (greater than 50,000 and 45,000-49,999) and lowest in low goal amount (less than 1000 and 1000-4999)
 
Challenges and Difficulties Encountered : 

One of the challenging aspect of this analysis was creating individual formulaes for different ranges of goals for  three different outcomes (successful, campaign and canceled campaigns).
But I overcame that by creating a word document by infidually creating the foumlae and then later using them in the table. Here is a snippet of some of the formula below:

Result

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? :

![Outcomes_on_Launch_Month_Table](https://github.com/faria-farin/MSUBootcamp_Challenge1/blob/main/Outcomes_on_Launch_Month_Table.png)

1. May is the best month to Launch a succesful campaign (111 successful outcomes and 52 failed)
2. December is the worst month to launch a campaign almost half of the campaign launched failed (37 successful, 35 failed) 
 Both May and Dec had 3 canceled campaigns

 What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

![Outcome_vs_Goals_Table](https://github.com/faria-farin/MSUBootcamp_Challenge1/blob/main/Outcome_vs_Goals_Table.png)

1. The most successful campaigns are the ones with least goal amount (less than 1000 = 75.8% and 1000 to 4999 = 72.7%)
 
2. The campaigns with very high goal amount are most likely to least successful ( Greater than 50000 = 16.7% and 45000 to 49999 = 0%) 
 

What are some limitations of this dataset?

There are many limitations of the dataset. It does not give information about the targeted population dempgraphic of the audience of the campaign, 
which would vastly effect the outcome of the goals. The age, race, gender, language spoken and income would have major effects on the outcomes, which wwere not considered in the data set. 

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

The other tables that could be created is looking at other campaign catergories like, music, publishing, movies, food and 
see separete each category into subcategories.For example: seperating music into jazz, rock, pop, country etc. We can also compare and contrast data by 
comparing different catergories with their goals to see which type of campaign is the most populer.
